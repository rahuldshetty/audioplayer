O GOD, whose only begotten Son, by His life, death and resurrection, has purchased for us the rewards of eternal salvation. Grant, we beseech Thee, that while meditating upon these mysteries, of the most Holy Rosary, of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we may both imitate what they contain and obtain what they promise through the same Christ, our Lord. Amen.
